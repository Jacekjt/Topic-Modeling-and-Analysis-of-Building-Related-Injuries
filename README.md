# Topic-Modelling-of-Building-Related-Injuries

A time-series analysis of the main themes related to building injuries.


##Data and Methods

All incidents with one or more injuries from January 2007 through October 2016.

Total of 4839 incidents with injuries. 

Text that briefly describes the incident.

Method: Topic modelling, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, used to uncover main themes in the text.

The method automatically develops “topics” from the text.

##Results

92% of the incidents were classified into 20 topics, 8% of the incidents could not be classified.
The 20 topics fit into 2 main categories:
1. Workers injured on the job, i.e. worker falling from structure, cuts to body, heart attack, etc. The titles of all of these topics begin with “worker”.
2. Building related incidents – Partial building collapse, vehicle hitting building, falling debris, etc.
